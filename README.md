# ng2-starter
Set of gulp predefined tasks and dependencies to work with Angular2 and Typescript.

The build system will run on top of some assumptions to make new application development easier if you follow those:

* All the source files are inside src folder
* All the source files are typescript
* All the tests you want to run ends with _spec.ts - This convention and procedure was taken from the angular2 source code repository
* All the compiled files will be put on dist folder


# to-do:
Alot, like

* Webpack integration (nice to have)
